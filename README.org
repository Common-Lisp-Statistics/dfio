* Reading text-based tabular data into Common Lisp

This is a library for reading text-based tabular data (such as CSV) into Common Lisp, using the [[https://github.com/Common-Lisp-Statistics/data-frame][data-frame]] library.

Documentation is currently incomplete, you should look at the unit tests.  A short demonstration:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (asdf:load-systems "dfio" "select" "dexador")

  (defparameter *d* (dfio:csv-to-data-frame
                     (format nil "Gender,Age,Height~@
                                  \"Male\",30,180.~@
                                  \"Male\",31,182.7~@
                                  \"Female\",32,1.65e2")))

  (select:select *d* t :gender)
      ; => #("Male" "Male" "Female")

  (let ((strings (select:select *d* t :gender)))
    (eq (aref strings 0) (aref strings 1)))
      ; => T, strings in the same column are interned once

  (select:select (dfio:csv-to-data-frame
                   (format nil "\"All kinds of wacky number formats\"~%.7~%19.~%.7f2"))
                  t :all-kinds-of-wacky-number-formats)
      ; => #(0.7d0 19.0d0 70.0)
#+END_SRC

You can read a CSV file into a ~data-frame~ like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defparameter *df* (dfio:csv-to-data-frame
		      (uiop:read-file-string "computers.csv"))) ; assumes file exists in current directory
#+END_SRC
Or from a network location:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defparameter *df* (dfio:csv-to-data-frame
		      (dex:get "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guru99-edu/R-Programming/master/computers.csv" :want-stream t)))
#+END_SRC
and write to a stream
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (dfio:data-frame-to-csv *df* :stream *standard-output* :add-first-row t) ; add column headers
#+END_SRC

* Running unit tests
  Unit tests are based on cl-unit. Run them at the REPL with ~(dfio-tests:run)~, or using ASDF: ~(asdf:test-system :dfio)~

** TODO more documentation

Talk about accepting numbers like =.1= and =1.=, possibility of parsing into R-like factors from string-tables

* Reporting bugs

Please report bugs using the [[https://github.com/Common-Lisp-Statistics/dfio/issues][issue tracker]].
